#JavaScript 2: jQuery and the DOM

These are notes for the second JavaScript workshop at NICAR2016 in Denver. This workshop was intended to follow intro to JavaScript and is best for very beginning programmers. However, you'll get the most of out of this if you have some familiarity with HTML and CSS.

The workshop is in two parts: a short presentation on HTML and the DOM and a longer hands-on session on DOM manipulation.

For the workshop, we use an example webpage I've built and we write our code in a separate .js file to establish best practices. To follow along, download this whole repo, open the `example` folder and double-click `index.html` to open the webpage in your browser. The .js file is located in `example/js/script.js`.

Alternatively these examples work just as well when you enter the code directly into the JavaScript console in your browser. To do that, open the hosted version of the [example webpage](http://scottpham.xyz/JS2WorkshopNICAR2016/example/) and then open your developer console. For Google Chrome browsers, [use this guide](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console). For Firefox, [use this guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console/Opening_the_Web_Console). For Internet Explorer, stop using Internet Explorer. Download Google Chrome or Firefox, click yes when asked to make it your default browser, and be a happier programmer.
